# BurgersMVCApp

(Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, MySQL) A website that uses the MVC pattern to track and update available burgers on a menu.

There were a lot of new concepts to parse for this project. We were given a directory structure, and I tried to make sure I understood what each file was intended to do before I coded anything, making notes and a map so I knew which files should be exported and required in other files.

I love the idea of an ORM, something that you can create that really is reusable in so many projects. And Handlebars.js is fascinating, though it all seems too "magic" to me at this point. Must read more about how templating engines work.
